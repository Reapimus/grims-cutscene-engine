Grim's Cutscene Engine is a Roblox module and plugin that allows its users to create custom cutscenes within it. It was created by me because I had a need for such a system, but was unable to find any existing systems that suited my needs.

This system has:

* Animation of characters, instances, the camera
* "Actions" (a unique type of keyframe that can initiate a piece of code that does something such as play a sound or create an explosion.)
* Subtitles
